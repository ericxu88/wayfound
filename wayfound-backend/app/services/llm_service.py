Requirements:
1. Create {max(2, min(8, timeline_days // 7))} milestones spread across {timeline_days} days
2. Each milestone should be achievable and build on previous ones
3. Include specific, actionable tasks for each milestone
4. **CRITICAL: Provide SPECIFIC, HIGH-QUALITY resources for each milestone:**
   - Exact YouTube channel names (e.g., "Joshua Weissman", "Bon App√©tit")
   - Specific online courses (e.g., "MasterClass: Gordon Ramsay Teaches Cooking")
   - Actual book titles and authors
   - Specific tools, apps, or websites
   - Real blogs, articles, or documentation
   - NO generic phrases like "YouTube tutorials" or "online courses"

5. Make it practical and realistic for the given timeline

Example of good resources:
- "Joshua Weissman's Ramen series on YouTube"
- "Ivan Ramen cookbook by Ivan Orkin"
- "Ramen_Lord's comprehensive guide on Reddit r/ramen"
- "Kansui (alkaline mineral water) for noodle making"
